# Startup Profit Predictor

Welcome to the **Startup Profit Predictor**, a Streamlit-based web application designed to forecast startup profits using a machine learning model. Developed by [Adan Tariq](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adantariq/), this project leverages linear regression to provide data-driven insights for business planning, launched on **September 28, 2025, at 04:08 PM PKT**.

## Overview
This application predicts startup profits based on key financial inputs: R&D spend, administration costs, marketing budgets, and geographic location (California, Florida, or New York). Built with Python and deployed using Streamlit, it offers an interactive interface for users to input data and visualize predictions.

## Features
- **Profit Prediction**: Utilizes a pre-trained linear regression model to estimate profits.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Sidebar inputs for R&D spend, administration costs, marketing budgets, and state selection.
- **Prediction History**: Tracks and displays all past predictions in a table.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, styled UI with a modern look and feel.
- **Local & Cloud Deployment**: Run locally or deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for the interactive app.
- **Joblib**: For loading the pre-trained model.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and structuring.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model training (used in development).
